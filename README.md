I developed this project because the original code lacked multi-step prediction for time series and lacked evaluation metrics.
It is sufficient to run train_single+mutiple_step.py, and the number of steps to predict can be controlled using seq_out_len. Number of features that need to modify num_nodes to match multiple features.
The overall result is good and suitable for baseline modelling. 
The dataset for this project is not provided.It is important to state that the datasets disclosed in this project are from the original, not my own, use of the datasets
