I developed this project because the original code lacked multi-step prediction for time series and lacked evaluation metrics.
It is sufficient to run train_single+mutiple_step.py, and the number of steps to predict can be controlled using seq_out_len. 
The overall result is good and suitable for baseline modelling. 
The dataset for this project is not provided.
